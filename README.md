Implement a Similarity Search Service with Python Framework, Docker, Testing, and Database Integration
Scenario: You're tasked with developing a similarity search service that takes an input query and searches for similar items in a database.
The service should provide functionality for adding new items to the database, searching for similar items based on the input query, and retrieving the search results.
Containerize the service using Docker for easy deployment and scalability. 
Additionally, need to include a database to store the items and facilitate efficient similarity searching.

<b>Upd for 2025.01.28:</b>
